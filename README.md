## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the assignment [Assignment Title]. The goal of this project was to [briefly describe the goal, e.g., analyze a dataset, implement a machine learning model, etc.]. In this work, I explored [briefly describe the main focus, e.g., a dataset, algorithms, etc.], and worked with [briefly describe the data used, e.g., "a dataset of housing prices," "a time series dataset of stock prices," etc.].

### Key Points:
- **Objective**: [Goal of the project]
- **Data**: [Data used, e.g., dataset name, source, type of data]
- **Methods**: [Methods used, e.g., regression analysis, classification, etc.]

## Implementation

In this section, I provide more detailed information on how the project was implemented using R. I used [list of R packages] to build the solution.

### Steps Taken:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: I started by loading and cleaning the dataset using `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
    ```r
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)
    
    # Load dataset
    data <- read.csv('data.csv')
    
    # Data cleaning: Remove missing values
    data <- na.omit(data)
    ```

2. **Feature Engineering**: I created new features based on existing data to improve the model's performance.
    ```r
    data <- data %>%
      mutate(new_feature = column1 * column2)
    ```

3. **Modeling**: I implemented a [model type, e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression] using the `randomForest` or `caret` package. Below is an example of building a random forest model.
    ```r
    library(randomForest)
    
    # Train Random Forest model
    model <- randomForest(target ~ ., data = data, importance = TRUE)
    
    # Print model summary
    print(model)
    ```

4. **Evaluation**: I evaluated the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and visualized the results with `ggplot2`.
    ```r
    library(caret)
    
    # Predictions
    predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)
    
    # Model evaluation
    confusionMatrix(predictions, test_data$target)
    ```

### Challenges:
- One issue I encountered was [describe any issues, e.g., data imbalance, overfitting], which I solved by [explain the solution, e.g., using oversampling techniques, regularization, tuning model parameters].

## Results / Conclusion

The model achieved an accuracy of [XX%] on the test set. Below is a plot showing [what the plot shows, e.g., feature importance, confusion matrix, etc.].

### Summary:
- The project allowed me to practice [what you learned, e.g., data preprocessing, model building in R, etc.].
- I learned that [insight you gained, e.g., which features were most important for the model's accuracy, etc.].
- This experience will help in future projects where I need to [relevant future application, e.g., build models in R, work with data, etc.].
