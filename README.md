# Armed Forces Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the assignment related to cleaning and tidying a dataset about the Armed Forces. The goal of this project was to preprocess and structure raw data into a clean, tidy format for analysis. In this work, I explored a dataset containing military personnel, budgets, and operational metrics across various time periods and countries.

### Key Points:
- **Objective**: Clean and preprocess the Armed Forces dataset to prepare it for further analysis or modeling.
- **Data**: The dataset contains information such as military personnel numbers, budgets, and other operational metrics from multiple countries and years.
- **Methods**: Data cleaning and transformation using R libraries such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`.

## Implementation

In this section, I provide more detailed information on how the project was implemented using R. I used several R packages like `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2` to clean and analyze the data.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: I started by loading the raw dataset and performing initial data cleaning. I used the `dplyr` package to filter out missing values and ensure that the columns had the correct data types.
    ```r
    library(dplyr)
    
    # Load dataset
    armed_forces_data <- read.csv('armed_forces_data.csv')
    
    # Remove rows with missing values
    armed_forces_clean <- armed_forces_data %>%
      filter(complete.cases(.))
    
    # Convert relevant columns to proper data types
    armed_forces_clean$Date <- as.Date(armed_forces_clean$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
    armed_forces_clean$Personnel <- as.integer(armed_forces_clean$Personnel)
    ```

2. **Tidying the Data**: To make the dataset more suitable for analysis, I reshaped the data into a long format using the `tidyr` package. This involved gathering all metrics into a single column while preserving the date and country.
    ```r
    library(tidyr)
    
    # Reshape data to long format
    armed_forces_long <- armed_forces_clean %>%
      gather(key = "Metric", value = "Value", -Date, -Country)
    ```

3. **Feature Engineering**: I created a new feature, `GrowthRate`, which calculated the percentage change in military personnel over time.
    ```r
    armed_forces_clean <- armed_forces_clean %>%
      mutate(GrowthRate = (Personnel - lag(Personnel)) / lag(Personnel) * 100)
    ```

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I performed basic exploratory data analysis to understand trends in the dataset. One of the visualizations I created was a line plot showing how the number of personnel changed over time.
    ```r
    library(ggplot2)
    
    # Plot personnel over time
    ggplot(armed_forces_clean, aes(x = Date, y = Personnel)) +
      geom_line() +
      labs(title = "Personnel Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Personnel Count")
    ```

### Challenges:
- One issue I encountered was **missing values** in some critical columns, which I solved by removing rows with missing data. In some cases, I chose to impute missing values when appropriate, but for key variables like `Personnel` and `Budget`, I opted for deletion to avoid introducing bias.
- **Outliers** in the `Budget` column were another challenge. Some values seemed too large to be realistic, so I used domain knowledge to filter out any budget values exceeding $5 million, as they were likely data entry errors.
- **Date Formatting**: Some date columns had inconsistent formats, which I unified using the `as.Date()` function to ensure all date-related data was properly formatted.

## Results / Conclusion

After cleaning and tidying the dataset, it is now ready for deeper analysis. The model could now be used for forecasting, time-series analysis, or further statistical modeling.

Below is a plot showing the trend in military personnel over time:

### Summary:
- The project allowed me to practice essential data cleaning and transformation techniques using R.
- I learned how important it is to properly preprocess data before analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- This experience will help me in future projects that involve working with messy data, particularly in time-series or cross-sectional datasets.
